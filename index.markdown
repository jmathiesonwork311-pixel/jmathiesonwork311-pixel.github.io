## About 
Hi, I'm Jamie Mathieson. Currently I am a computer science student at the University of Adelaide - Becoming Adelaide University - I'm currently in my first internship cycle and I am eager to impress!

Come take a look at the things I am interested in! From projects to books I am reading these summarise my computer science interactions pretty accurately.
### Projects!
