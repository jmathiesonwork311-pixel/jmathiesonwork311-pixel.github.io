# [Black-scholes interpreter](https://github.com/SaadanNaqvi/Black-Scholes-Option-Pricer) ! 

This project is one I did for my university courses, it leverages object oriented design, github tools, CSVs, and Raylib to create a GUI that users can interact with and use to buy/sell artificial stocks based on the black-scholes equation!

As my first collaborative project I'm proud of how it turned out, and I'm eager to keep working to blow way past this in skill!
