# [Hashing project](https://github.com/jmathiesonwork311-pixel/Hashing-project) !

This project for me was all about learning and understanding the C++ library better! 

The main goal of this project is to make my own C++ hashmaps and sets. To do this I have leveraged tools such as OOP, classes, header files, and templates to recreate the functionality of maps in standard C++. I have even gone beyond the standard C++ library and made it so that I can hash non-typically hashable objects in c++!
